            During this internship i worked on one of the UI team responsible for the HMH flagship product HMH ED.
            <br />
            Here i learned the React framework using the Single SPA pattern, unit testing, integration testing, and End to End testing.
            <br />
            i learned crucial skills, following an agile development methodology participating in sprints, completing tickets. The most important aspect that i learned was the CI pipeline for building complex software and traiging the build process across multiple teams.
